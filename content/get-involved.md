Complete [this Google form](https://forms.gle/hBzSwgGBKBHwUwVh9 "Submit an idea for an Ã©ist radio show") to submit your idea for a show on Ã©ist.

Shows will be streamed and credited on Ã©ist. Shows can be 1 or 2 hours long and are scheduled on a weekly or monthly basis. Ã©ist is an entirely volunteer run community arts project. As such, we cannot pay you for your show.

We're looking for new voices and fresh ideas. We want to hear music and sounds that are not represented anywhere else. Help us build this radio station ðŸ”¥

Please note that due to the large number of submissions we receive, we might not be able to program your show.
