We are now looking to build our first radio schedule for Spring/Earrach that will run from February through to the end of April 2025.

Submit your idea for a show with the form below. Shows will be streamed and credited on Ã©ist radio. Shows can be 1 or 2 hours long and are scheduled on a weekly or monthly basis. Ã©ist is an entirely volunteer run community arts project. As such, we cannot pay you for your show.

We are currently building out the Ã©ist studio where we hope to do the majority of our live broadcasting. We can also help you to submit pre-record shows or live broadcasts from your home as required, should you prefer.

We're looking for new voices and fresh ideas. We want to hear music and sounds that are not represented anywhere else. Help us build this radio station ðŸ”¥

Please note that due to the large number of submissions we receive, we might not be able to program your show.
