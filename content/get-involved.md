We are now looking to build our first radio schedule for Spring/Imbolc that will run from February through to the end of April 2025.

Please submit your idea for a show with the form below. If chosen, your show will be streamed and credited on Éist radio. Shows are 1 hour in length and scheduled on a weekly or monthly basis.

We are currently building out the Éist studio where we hope to do the majority of our live broadcasting. We can also help you to submit pre-record shows or live broadcasts from your home as required, should you prefer.

We're looking for new voices and fresh ideas. We want to hear music and sounds that are not represented elsewhere. Help us build our radio station! Complete [this Google form](https://forms.gle/hBzSwgGBKBHwUwVh9 "Submit an idea for an Éist radio show") to submit your idea.

**Deadline for submission is January 10th.**
