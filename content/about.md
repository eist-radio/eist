éist is a volunteer-run internet radio collective based in Cork city, Ireland.

We are dedicated to fostering creativity, collaboration, and community engagement through **DIGITAL RADIO**.

We aim to promote and support community-driven digital radio initiatives, provide resources, knowledge sharing, skill sharing, and networking opportunities.

We want to encourage the production and dissemination of a diverse variety of audio content, and foster a sense of community among members through collaboration and shared projects.

éist seeks to promote diverse voices and build a supportive network for all members in an inclusive environment. **We do not tolerate sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, antisemitism, classism or other forms of discrimination.**

éist supports the Palestinian-led [Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS)](https://www.bdsmovement.net/what-bds) movement for freedom, justice and equality. BDS upholds the simple principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity.

Our commitment to anti-colonialism is not symbolic. It informs the content we platform, the spaces we nurture, and the relationships we engage in. As a collective rooted in global solidarity, we are guided by the principles of movements like the BDS campaign, which urges refusal with collaborations that normalize systemic oppression or presents false symmetry between oppressor and oppressed.
Anti-colonialism demands clarity, resistance, and refusal to normalize injustice under the guise of dialogue or neutrality.
