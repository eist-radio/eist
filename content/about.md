**Radio Solstice** is an online radio station and an ear to the Otherworld, receiving sounds from the 'thin places' where our world connects most closely with the world of dreams, the afterlife and the unseen. As in Irish folk tales, where a traveller on a country road follows sounds of revelry coming from a magic portal in a hill or a field only to discover the land of the Sídhe, Radio Solstice is a digital receiver to otherworldly frequencies, where things unseen don’t go unheard.

Radio Solstice first arose in June 2024, broadcasting from Test Site in Cork City across two weekends of the Cork Midsummer Festival. In December 2024, Radio Solstice retreated inwards, celebrating our theme: 'home star' at Blackrock Castle Observatory. In June 2025, contemplate the idea of 'new mythologies'.
