Éist is a collective based in Cork city, Ireland.

We are dedicated to fostering creativity, collaboration, and community engagement through **DIGITAL RADIO**.

We aim to promote and support community-driven digital radio initiatives and provide resources, knowledge-sharing, skill-sharing, and networking opportunities.

We want to encourage the production and dissemination of a diverse variety of audio content, and foster a sense of community among members through collaboration and shared projects.

Éist seeks to promote diverse voices and build a supportive network for all members in an inclusive environment. We do not tolerate sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, classism or other forms of discrimination.
