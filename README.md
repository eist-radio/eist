Source files for the https://eist.radio website.

# Getting started

Install Hugo, see: https://gohugo.io/installation/

# Adding content and building docs

Add a new markdown file with a TOML format header into the `content/` folder:

```markdown
+++
title = "The title!"
date = 2024-11-19T20:23:18Z
draft = false
+++

Add some text!

```

Add `noindex = true` if you don't want the page to be indexed by the Goog.

# Checking your build locally

Get the API key from RadioCult and save it in a `.env` file locally, for example:

```cmd
cat .env
API_KEY=<REDACTED>
```

Then:

```cmd
source .env
export API_KEY
hugo server
```

On Windows:

```cmd
set API_KEY=xxxxx
```
